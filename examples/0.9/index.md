These example codes don't provide the complete code, because the exact code depends on which backend you are using. The examples therefore don't contain the TGUI includes and don't show how the window and gui are constructed. The missing code is described in the ['Getting started' tutorials](/tutorials/0.9/#getting-started).

Each example consists of a "runExample" function that would be called after the gui is constructed and before the main loop starts.
